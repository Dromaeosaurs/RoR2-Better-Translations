# RoR2-Better-Translations

This is the 5th or 6th iteration of my english translations for RoR2, previous ones were either:
 
-Completely  rewriten

 -Deleted/Corrupted (my HDD died not too long ago :( )

**Notes:** 
 
 -This is not finished _yet_, also not 100% of it is going to be translated because I want to keep the game playable. 
 
 -_Funni colors included!_
 
 -This will **overwrite** english files, meaning that it will work in vanilla!
 
 -If you want to get rid of them, just verify game's files.
